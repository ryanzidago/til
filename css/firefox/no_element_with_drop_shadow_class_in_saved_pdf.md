# Elements with the `drop-shadow` class (from TailwindCSS) aren't rendered at all when saving a PDF in Firefox

At the time of writing (2023-09-27), when printing a web page into a PDF using Firefox, elements with the `drop-shadow` class (from TailwindCSS) aren't rendered at all!
They might appear in the PDF preview, but once the file is saved, they won't appear anymore.
